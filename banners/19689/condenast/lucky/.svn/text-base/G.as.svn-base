//1. import the class into your project where ever you need a variable to be able to be accessed from anywhere else in the project.
//2. set the global var: GlobalVars.vars.[NameOfGlobal] = [Data to store];
//3. access the global var: GlobalVars.vars.[NameOfGlobal]
//4. Rinse
//5. Repeat
//
//I didn't come up with the idea myself, but I did take the 15 seconds to write the class.
